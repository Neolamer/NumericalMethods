# NumericalMethods
This program implements tasks from the university course Numerical Methods.

At the moment, the program is implemented on the basis of a console application launched via a .bat file.

### How to run 

To run the program in the current configuration, you need to download and place in the same folder NumericalMethods.jar and Start.bat.

When you start the program, you can select and start the required module by pressing button numbers.
