#Interpolation method

####the algorithm is implemented in class [InterpolationSolution](./InterpolationSolution.java)

The problem is to find the interpolating function F(x) = y, 
which allows you to find what values the function takes 
at points that are not nodes. In this program, we use an 
interpolation Lagrange polynomial - a polynomial of minimal degree
that takes all values in a given set of points.
